# BTS-OCR 

In our digital era, document digitization and data extraction play a crucial role, but existing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) systems face challenges in accurately converting text to digital formats. This hampers efficiency and precision, creating obstacles in seamless data extraction. Despite progress, issues like character misinterpretation, limited language support, difficulty with handwritten text, and varied document formats persist.

## Project Overview

This project aims to enhance the OCR system, addressing these challenges head-on. The focus is on improving accuracy, expanding language support, handling handwritten text more effectively, and ensuring adaptability to diverse document layouts.

## Key Objectives

1. **Enhanced Accuracy**: Implement algorithms and improvements to increase the accuracy of text conversion, minimizing character misinterpretation.

2. **Language Support**: Broaden language support to ensure the OCR system can handle a wide range of languages effectively.

3. **Handwritten Text Recognition**: Develop features to better handle handwritten text, overcoming the current limitations.

4. **Adaptability to Document Layouts**: Ensure the OCR system is adaptable to various document formats and layouts for versatile digitization.
